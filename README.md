# Quark - Interactive Real Time Video Editing and Audio Playback Control

Created a multiplayer Apple TV application where each player is able to edit video in real time with different iPhone gestures. App also allows for control of audio stream playback by scanning the corresponding QR codes

Used the Core Image framework and Swift for iOS to create versatile image filters which I applied to individual video frames

Worked on and finished this project at USC's HackSC 2015
